Tabu Search

Define the following for the search 

Neighborhood::: Single-flip neighborhood
Tabu Memory:::  Number of moves
Selection of Candidate List::: From neighborhood that doesn't include tabu solutions
Evaluation Function:::
 Tabu Criterion: Whether an element in the index has been flipped
 Aspiration Criteria::  If a tabu solution encountered at the current iteration is better than the best solution found so far, then its tabu status is overridden 
 choice of tabu tenur:: 5
